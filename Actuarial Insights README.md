Actuarial Data Analysis Portfolio
Welcome!
Thank you for visiting my actuarial data analysis portfolio. My name is Trevor, and I am an Actuarial Associate at Sanlam. This portfolio showcases my capabilities in statistical analysis and financial modeling, primarily using Microsoft Excel. The projects included here are based on simulated data that resemble real-world scenarios, focusing on reinsurance, risk profile assessments, and the analysis of loss ratios for insurance companies. These projects are designed to demonstrate the analytical techniques and methodologies I use, without disclosing any confidential or proprietary information.

About This Repository
This repository serves as a demonstration of my actuarial and analytical skills. Each project uses hypothetical data sets designed to mirror the complexities and challenges of actual actuarial work. The purpose of these projects is to:

Reinsurance Analysis: Explore the effectiveness of various reinsurance treaties and arrangements in managing risk.
Risk Profile Assessment: Analyze simulated customer data to assess risk levels and predict potential impacts on the business.
Loss Ratios: Evaluate the financial performance of insurance portfolios through the calculation and analysis of loss ratios.
Tools Used
The primary tool used in these projects is Microsoft Excel. Excel facilitates:

Complex data manipulations and scenario analysis.
Creation of advanced formulas and functions for deep data insights.
Production of dynamic charts and tables for data presentation and storytelling.
Projects
Each folder within this repository corresponds to a specific project based on generic data models:

Project Files: Due to confidentiality, the actual Excel files cannot be shared. However, each project folder contains a comprehensive README detailing the methodologies, processes, and results of the analyses.
Documentation: For each project, you will find detailed descriptions, including the objectives, tools used, and key findings. Visual aids such as charts and graphs are represented through screenshots to provide clarity on the analysis performed.
